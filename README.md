## About

The Xenopus Anatomy Ontology (XAO) is a structured, controlled vocabulary of the anatomy and development of the African frog genus *Xenopus*. Anatomical entities are organized in a classification structure based on the [Common Anatomy Reference Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/caro). They are described as being `part_of` other entities, while the lineage of tissues in the course of embryonic and tadpole development is represented by `develops_from` relationships. The developmental timing of each tissue and structure is indicated by a `start stage` and `end stage`, based on the Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) staging series. Many entities are cross-referenced to the [GO](https://github.com/geneontology), [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology), and [Uberon](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon).

The ontology is used to annotate and query gene expression data in [Xenbase](http://www.xenbase.org/), the *Xenopus* model organism database, and is designed to facilitate cross-taxa comparisons.

The XAO is at release [v6.0](https://github.com/xenopus-anatomy/xao/releases/tag/v6.0).
