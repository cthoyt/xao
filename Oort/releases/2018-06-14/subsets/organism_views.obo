def: "Organism subdivision that is the terminal, flexible posterior appendage of the larva. It is resorbed during metamorphosis beginning with degeneration of the notochord's distal tip at NF stage 61, followed by degeneration gradually extending to its more proximal regions and reaching its proximal end by NF stage 62. By NF stage 66 it exists only as a small dorsal swelling." [http://dictionary.reference.com/medical/tail, ISBN:0471209627]
