It starts to develop along the trunk and tail of the embryo at the tail bud stage and continues to grow until the start of metamorphosis when it begins to regress. It consists of flattened epidermal cells elevated into a keel-like structure by a supporting core of mesenchyme and extracellular matrix." [PMID:15188431]

name: brain

def: "Organ that is a component of the central nervous system and is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of information from the senses. It appears when the neural tube segregates in forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain at NF stage 22. The general pattern of the brain has been mainly established at NF stage 28. Yolky material is consumed and the fibre tracts and later the commissures develop. In general all of its parts are well developed at NF stage 53 and later development consists mainly of growth and some further cytological differentiation. In the period of metamorphosis only topographical changes take place." [http://dictionary.reference.com/medical/brain, ISBN:0815318960]

name: neural crest
namespace: xenopus_anatomy
def: "A group of ectoderm cells that delaminate from the area between the neuroectoderm/non-neural ectoderm domains. They undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal tranformation (EMT) and migrate to give several different lineages of adult cells. Originating from different positions along the anterior-posterior axis, they develop into various tissues. These regions of neural crest can be divided into five main functional domains, which include the cranial, trunk, vagal and sacral neural crest, and cardiac neural crest. Neural crest cells are considered multipotent, and as they have the limited capacity for self renewal, they are regarded as stem cell-like." [AAO:0010578, XAO:CJZ]
